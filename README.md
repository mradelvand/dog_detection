# dog_detection
#Using raspberry pi and azure
#In this project, a smart camera is designed and implemented to detect dogs in an urban environment. Whenever a movement is detected, the camera takes a photo and sends it to a cloud server for analysis. In addition, if the image is recognized as a dog, it will be sent to the user through the Telegram bot.
